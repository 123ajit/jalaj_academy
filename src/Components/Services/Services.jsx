                I first started practicing on Jalaj Academy when I was preparing
                for my matric. I thought Jalaj Academy was only for 9th class.
                Later I found it was much more than that. I am studying everyday
                from Jalaj Academy on many topics
              </p>

                Jalaj Sir has changed my life by so much. I mostly practice on
                The World of Math. I was amazed by how good this website was. I
                was failing in my first marking period in Math. Now this website
                has helped me so much. I am so good at Math and it has improved
                my work by a lot.

                I teach 12 year olds the beauty of mathematics. Thanks to Jalaj
                and his team, my days are filled with teaching and coaching
                rather than paperwork and frustration. The immediate feedback my
                students receive is so valuable! No more "I did all 30 problems
                wrong? Oh well" kind of attitude. They're motivated, can
                celebrate their strengths and focus on their needs. The success
                they experience is beyond compare! Thank you, thank you, THANK
                YOU!

                Jalaj Sir has opened doors and my life will forever be changed
                as a result of that. I have been taught to think differently, to
                value persistence, to be curious; my plan for my life has been
                changed as a result of what I have been exposed to. I have been
                able to fill in gaps in my education which my younger, careless
                self allowed for. I really am thankful for this wonderful
                program which has given more to me than these words suffice to
                say and for everyone who is a part of it. Especially you, Jalaj
                Sir--thank you above all for being someone I can count on.
